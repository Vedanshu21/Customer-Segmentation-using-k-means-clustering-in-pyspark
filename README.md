# Customer-Segmentation-using-k-means-clustering-in-pyspark

This project focuses on Customer segmentation and analysis using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model using an unsupervised machine learning model "K-means clustering" in PySpark which is a Python API for Apache Spark. It enables real-time, large-scale data processing in a distributed environment using Python.<br>

RFM analysis allows marketers to target specific clusters of customers with communications that are much more relevant for their particular behavior â€“ and thus generate much higher rates of response, plus increased loyalty and customer lifetime value.

## Dataset:
The dataset used is an e-commerce dataset that contains transactions for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail from 2010 to 2011 and is provided freely from The UCI Machine Learning Repository. You can download the data here.<br>

The dataset contains the following relevant columns needed for our analysis:<br>
<ul>
<li>InvoiceNo. Unique id for each sale.</li>
<li>StockCode. Unique id for each product.</li>
<li>Quantity. Number of units bought.</li>
<li>InvioceDate. Date of the sale.</li>
<li>UnitPrice. Retail price of the product.</li>
<li>CustomerID. Unique id for each customer</li>
</ul>
